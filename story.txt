There was a lady in waiting, let's call her Jane. That girl was not oridinary. She rather battle a fire-breathing dragon than be a lady in waiting. Her friends laughed at her but she was not discouraged and trained in secret. She went to the dragon's home to slain the dragon. In the dragon's cave, she realized the dragon was not dangerous and rather sweet. Now she travels with the dragon.

On the first day's travel, Jane came to realize that traveling with a dragon would not be all fun.  Upon encountering a cow in the road, the dragon could not contain its hunger and gobbled it right up, much to the chagrin of the farmer.

"What are you doing with that Dragon? It's eating my livestock!", the farmer exclaimed. "I don't know what you're talking about", Jane told the farmer. "I've never seen this dragon in my life." Jane and the dragon continued down the road, ignoring the farmers outrage at the incident. Jane led the dragon down the road towards the dark woods on the horizon, where she planned on ditching the dragon and having a more enjoyable travel experience.

"Achoo! Achoo! I haven't stopped sneezing since I met you, dragon" Jane exclaimed to her new companion. "I have also been coughing, experiencing shortness of breath, and I think I have a very high fever!" "Don't worry, it's probably nothing," said the dragon as he remembered how many hands he shook in the village that day. "I have an idea!" he exclaimed with glee. "Let's extend our quest and get on this lovely cruise ship. I think now is a perfect time to travel the world and interact with as many people as we can!" Jane shrugged; "Ok, I am sure my underlying health conditions will not have any effect on our international travels. Oh, and don't bother bringing any hand sanitizer. I don't plan on washing my hands when I'm on vacation."
