There was a lady in waiting, let's call her Jane. That girl was not oridinary. She rather battle a fire-breathing dragon than be a lady in waiting. Her friends laughed at her but she was not discouraged and trained in secret. She went to the dragon's home to slain the dragon. In the dragon's cave, she realized the dragon was not dangerous and rather sweet. Now she travels with the dragon.
On the first day's travel, Jane came to realize that traveling with a dragon would not be all fun.  Upon encountering a cow in the road, the dragon could not contain its hunger and gobbled it right up, much to the chagrin of the farmer.
